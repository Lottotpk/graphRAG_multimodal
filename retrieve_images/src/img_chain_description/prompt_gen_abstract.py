    Inputs (always provided)
    - Query image: The image input to analyze
    - Example answer: The correct answer of the example image (Starry Night)
    - Image summary: The image summary as an additional relationship
    - Categories: description aspect to consider
    - Example keywords: possibly keyword from each category; you can use keywords other than the example
    - Example explanation: definitions of each example, which can be used as references

    Example answer

    Workflow (apply for each category in Categories)
    0) Understand the image summary
    - Explore details from text description as an additional context along with the Query image
    1) Analyze the Query image
    - Identify up to 3 relevant keywords according to the category based on the evidence from the Query image, such as the main characters' expression, the place, and the Query image vibe.
    2) Justify each keyword
    - Make a compact reason for each keyword on why this keyword is chosen over other keywords that sound similar and why not the other keywords on the opposite. The clues are included in the reason. The length is not more than 20 words.
    3) Evaluate grounding
    - Analyzing grounding behind the reasons: whether each reason from keyword can be linked to the visual evidence in the Query image.
    - No making up explanation or implication: For example, "Gallery Wall Art" is for arts not the photography, so the reason behind it has to be synchronus and grounding.
    - Mentally simulate the situation using the image for the "Purpose/Context" category whether the keyword intuitively make sense in that specific context or not.
    4) Summarize & Score
    - Write keywords and its reason after evaluation
    - Output a confidence score (0.0â€“1.0), where 1.0 = highly relevant, 0.0 = irrelevant reflecting: the relevance between keyword and reason and Query image, the mental simulation, and the grounding candidates observed from the Query image.
    5) Selection
    - Strictly remove all keywords with confidence score lower than 0.7 even though that category remains zero keywords.
    - Category with zero keywords can simply use [] (the empty list in response)

    Output Requirements
    - Return strictly valid JSON only (no prose, no markdown, no comments).
    - Use exactly these top-level keys and types for each category in Categories:
    %s

    Validation Checklist (must pass before you output)
    - JSON is strictly valid: no trailing commas; correct double quotes; confidence is a number; correct the comma delimiter; beware of unterminated string; enclose the double quotes; enclose the brackets.
    - Each "keyword" contains 1-2 words, 1 reason, and 1 confidence number.
    - Each "reason" is a single crispy sentence with no more than 20 words.
    - Avoid generic keyword; recalculate confidence of the keyword with highly repeated usages across every image
    - At most 3 keywords per "category", no more than this; can use less than this
    - Reasons and evidence can be found from the Query image; No making up the answer.
    - Using the example only as a reference, generate the output for the image.
    - All the keywords with confidence score lower than 0.7 are excluded from the output.
